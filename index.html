        Doing something like this helps (a bit) to understand what's happening under the hood of tools like React. By directly working with the DOM API, you can begin to see the justification for why React is designed the way it is... I will do a blog post on this to elaborate, will link back here when ready.

        The other lesson is even if a program is small, or impractical, or can be done better in a million ways, there is still much an observant and reflective mind can takeaway. </p>
